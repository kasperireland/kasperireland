### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Speaklink; a matrix client powered by Matrix & Element. It's goal is to simplify communications on the internet while having top-notch security, and being privacy-oriented. It is currently the most secure chat/communications platform on the internet (excluding Matrix of course, since it runs on Matrix!)

âš¡ I've owned and have been managing Swivro since 2016, accessible at swivro.net

ðŸ“« You can reach me via the Swivro support email at support@swivro.com which will get forwarded to my Gmail, and then I will reply to you from my Gmail.
